# A Biogeographic Barrier

Point Conception in California is a significant biogeographic barrier for many marine species.

[biogeographic barrier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434317300365): a boundary where many species reach the limit of their geographic range

The unique coastal topography and prevailing ocean currents around this headland create a barrier to northward larval dispersal (Figure 1). As climate change drives species to generally migrate poleward in search of suitable habitats, biogeographic breaks may hinder range expansions by limiting dispersal opportunities. This makes ecological hotspots like Point Conception particularly vulnerable, as species restricted to the south of this break may face range contractions rather than expansions.
