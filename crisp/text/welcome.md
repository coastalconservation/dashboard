Welcome to the California Ranges of Intertidal Species Portal (CRISP).

CRISP is an interactive tool designed to explore the distribution of rocky intertidal species along the California coast.

Use the tabs on the left to learn more about the project's background, view the current species ranges, explore how these ranges have changed over time, and see how they may shift in the future due to climate change. You can also dive into the data behind the project and understand the limitations of the analysis.
