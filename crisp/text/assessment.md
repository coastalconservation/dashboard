As a way to combine the results of the Range Edges, Abundance Trends, and Projected Shifts analyses and identify species that may be at risk of a range extension or range contraction, this page creates a Priority monitoring assessment. 

This page brings together the results from the three different analyses: Range Edges, Abundance Trends, and Projected Shifts. By combining these results, we can identify species that may be experiencing range expansions or contractions near Point Conception.

The result is a Priority Monitoring Assessment - a tool to help highlight which species may need closer attention moving forward.
