# Limitations 

Issues with data temporally and spatially. The Coastal Biodiversity Survey Data is only conducted at each site every 5 to 7 years. Additionally, the sites are not evenly distributed throughout the coast. Additionally, some species are rare or difficult to identify, which can lead to underreporting or inconsistent observations.

The habitat suitability and species distribution models used here are based solely on a set of five environmental variables. These models do not include biological factors like how a species disperses, interacts with others, or encounters physical barriers that might prevent it from shifting its range. As a result, the models are best understood as estimates of suitable habitat based on where a species has been observed and the surrounding environmental conditions.

This study could be strengthened by incorporating more species observation data, modeling under different climate emission scenarios, and accounting for additional factors that influence where species’ distributions.
