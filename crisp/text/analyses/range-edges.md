The range edge analysis maps the distribution of rocky intertidal species whose range edges fall within each 100-kilometer segment of the coastline. In this analysis, a range edge is defined as the northernmost and southernmost points where a species group, or taxa, has been surveyed. Identifying these range edges is important for monitoring how distributions may shift over time, especially in response to climate change.

The two interactive Leaflet maps below display the number of rocky intertidal taxa that have northern or southern range edges along California's coastline. You can hover over a segment to see the exact number of taxa that reach their maximum latitude habitat range within that segment. By clicking on a segment, you will receive more information about the taxa that reside in that area, which will be displayed in the data table.

Notably, Northern Point Conception and Southern Point Conception emerge as hotspots for range edges. These two coastline segments represent an important biogeographic break where many rocky intertidal species reach their distribution limits. This makes them particularly valuable for further studies on how species and species groups respond to environmental changes.
