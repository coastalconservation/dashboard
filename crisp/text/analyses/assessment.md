The priority monitoring assessment provides a comprehensive analysis of rocky intertidal species or species groups at Northern Point Conception and Southern Point Conception. It consolidates findings from three previous analyses: Range Edges, Contemporary Range Shifts, and Projected Shifts, into a tiered system that indicates conservation priorities. This system highlights higher-ranking intertidal species or species groups that may face greater challenges due to climate change.

The two interactive data tables below evaluate the priority monitoring for species or species groups that are experiencing either a range extension or a range contraction. By using the checkbox widgets, you can filter by priority level or additional conditions to see which species meet your selected criteria.
