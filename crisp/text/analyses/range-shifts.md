The contemporary range shift analysis plots the northern and southern boundaries of each taxon identified in the previous analysis with range edges at Northern Point Conception and Southern Point Conception. For this analysis, the northern and southern boundaries are defined as the 95th and 5th percentiles, respectively, of their distribution along the coastline for each taxa. This approach removes outliers and allows for a focused examination of the core range over time. Monitoring these contemporary range shifts is crucial for understanding how rocky intertidal species near Point Conception have adapted to their environment, either by successfully expanding their habitat range or facing the risk of range contraction.

The dumbbell plot below displays the contemporary range shifts of the selected taxa over five-year intervals, with distances measured in kilometers from the California/Mexico border. You can hover over the y-axis to identify landmarks and understand where the latitude boundaries may fall on the map. Additionally, there is a static map of Californiaâ€™s coastline that includes corresponding distances, along with a diagram to help you interpret the extent of each dumbbell on the plot.
