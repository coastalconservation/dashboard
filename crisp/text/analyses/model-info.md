The projected shifts analysis maps the distribution of rocky intertidal species at Northern Point Conception and Southern Point Conception, focusing on their current habitat suitability, projected habitat suitability for 2050, and changes in habitat suitability under varying environmental conditions. 

- Ocean temperature (Â°Celcius)
- Mixed layer depth (Meters)
- Salinity (PSU)
- Dissolved oxygen (millimoles per meter cubed)
- Cloud cover (Percent %)

The maps are generated using species distribution models that incorporate survey data and environmental variables to predict where a specified taxon is most likely to be found along the coast. While many other ecological, environmental, and physical factors influence a species' habitat, this model provides a valuable starting point for understanding potential habitat patterns. Projecting habitat suitability is especially important for conservation efforts, as it helps prepare for the impacts and risks associated with habitat gain or loss.
