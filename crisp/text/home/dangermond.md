In December 2017, The Nature Conservancy in California acquired the 24,364-acre preserve. Since then, they have developed a vision for this land that focuses on enhancing conservation, scientific research, and education. The preserve has remained largely undeveloped for nearly 100 years and features unique geography and topography, making it a hotspot for biodiversity. However, as environmental conditions continue to change, both the preserve and its biodiversity are at risk from the impacts of climate change.
