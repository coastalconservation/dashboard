Historically, this species was limited to waters south of Point Conception, California.  However, warming ocean temperatures and changing current patterns, particularly during extreme events like El Niño, have enabled its larvae to disperse farther north.

In recent decades, stable populations of Kellet’s Whelk have been documented up to 300 kilometers beyond their historical range, including areas like Big Creek in Central California ([López et al., 2025](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps_oa/m753p073.pdf)). Genetic research suggests that these expanded-range populations likely result from episodic long-distance dispersal events rather than continuous northward movement. As a subtidal predator with ecological and commercial significance, the expansion of Kellet’s Whelk highlights how climate-driven changes can restructure marine communities, altering species interactions, food webs, and fisheries.

This example illustrates how range shifts are not only driven by temperature but also by complex interactions between oceanographic events, life history traits like larval duration, and habitat availability.
