A biogeographic barrier is a physical boundary where many species or species groups reach the limit of their geographic range. Point Conception is a well known landmark that lies at a unique coastal topography with prevailing ocean currents around this headland that creates a physical barrier to northward movement of larvae (Figure 1). As climate change drives species to generally migrate poleward in search of suitable habitat, biogeographic breaks may hinder range expansions by limiting dispersal opportunities. This makes ecological hotspots like Point Conception particularly vulnerable, as species restricted to the south of this break may face range contractions rather than range expansions.
