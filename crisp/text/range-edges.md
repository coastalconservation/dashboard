### **Historic Range Edges**

This analysis maps the distribution of intertidal species whose range edges fall within each 100 km coastline segment. A range edge is defined as the northernmost or southernmost point where a species has been recorded. Identifying these edges is important for tracking how species distributions may shift over time, especially in response to climate change.

The two interactive maps below show the northern and southern range edges of rocky intertidal species. Each map is paired with a data table displaying species that reach their range limits within the selected segment. **Click on a segment to explore which species are present at those boundaries!**

Notably, Northern Point Conception and Southern Point Conception emerge as biodiversity hotspots: key locations where many species reach their distributional limits. These areas mark an important biogeographic break, making them especially valuable for studying how species respond to environmental changes.
