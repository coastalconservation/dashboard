Issues with data temporally and spatially. The Coastal Biodiversity Survey Data is only conducted at each site every 5 to 7 years. Additionally, the sites are not evenly distributed throughout the coast. Additionally, some species are rare or difficult to identify, which can lead to underreporting or inconsistent observations.

The contemporary range shift models did not apply statistical tests to their linear model results. However, the GAM and CDF modeling incorporated rigorous ecological validation procedures to ensure outputs aligned with rocky intertidal ecosystem dynamics. We recommend employing robust statistical tests to assess the significance and reliability of linear model outputs, thereby complementing the ecological validation used in the GAM and CDF approaches.

The habitat suitability and species distribution models used here are based solely on a set of five environmental variables. These models do not include biological factors like how a species disperses, interacts with others, or encounters physical barriers that might prevent it from shifting its range. As a result, the models are best understood as estimates of suitable habitat based on where a species has been observed and the surrounding environmental conditions.

This study could be strengthened by incorporating more species observation data, modeling under different climate emission scenarios, and accounting for additional factors that influence where speciesâ€™ distributions.
